        <h2 id="recent-publications">Co-optimizing Algorithms and Systems for Highly Scalable Graph Learning</h2>
        

        <p><strong>Project Description: </strong> Recent years have seen a surge of interest in machine learning on graphs, with the goal ofencoding high-dimensional data associated with nodes, edges, or (sub)graphs into low-dimensional vector representations that well preserve the original graph structural (manifold) information. Graph learning techniques have shown promising results for various important applications such as vertex (data) classi-fication, link prediction (recommendation
        systems), community detection, drug discovery, and electronicdesign automation (EDA). However, even the state-of-the-art graph learning methods do not scale comfortably to large data setsdue to their high algorithm complexity. On the other hand, the latest theoretical breakthroughs in spectral graph theory have led to the development of nearly-linear time spectral graph compression (sparsifica-tion and coarsening) algorithms for computing much smaller graphs while preserving the key
        spectral properties of the original graph (e.g., the first few eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian). In turn, these techniques can potentially lead to the development of much faster algorithms for solvingpartial differential equations and linear systems of equations, spectral clustering and graph partitioning,low-dimensional graph embedding, dimensionality reduction, and data visualizationi.</p>
        
        <p>The proposed research targets co-optimizing algorithms and systems for highly scalable graph learning leveraging spectral graph compression techniques. Unlike prior theoretical studiesin the area of spectral graph theory that put less focus on practical algorithm implementations and applications, the proposed research plan will for the first time investigate nearly-linear time spectral graphcompression  techniques so that real-world, large-scale (directed, undirected, or hyper-)
        graphs can be benifficiently converted into a hierarchy of spectrally-similar coarse-level graphs with decreasing sizes but well-preserved graph structural (global) properties.  </p>
